# Backlog

> Manage the backlog of your project with just markdown in git.
> The goal is to provide a frictionless collaboration between AI agents and developers

Backlog is a zero-configuration task manager written in Go where tasks live inside a Git repository. It leverages plain Markdown files for task storage and a comprehensive command-line interface (CLI) for interaction. This design makes it exceptionally well-suited for AI agents thanks to its MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration.

The system is designed to be offline-first and completely portable, as the entire project state is contained within the Git repository.

**For a complete overview of the project, please see the [main README.md file on GitHub](https://github.com/veggiemonk/backlog/blob/main/README.md).**
