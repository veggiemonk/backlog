# CLI Examples Fix - Implementation Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-09
**Status**: âœ… Complete
**Issue**: CLI reference documentation not rendering correctly on website; examples needed proper markdown formatting

## Problems Identified

### 1. Inconsistent Example Formatting
- **Issue**: Most commands used comment-style examples (`# comment`) that didn't render well
- **Impact**: Examples were hard to read on the website, inconsistent across commands
- **Root Cause**: Commands weren't using markdown code blocks for examples

### 2. Missing Examples
- **Issue**: Some commands (archive) had no examples at all
- **Impact**: Users had to guess how to use certain commands

## Solution Implemented

### Pattern Established (from view command)
Used the `view` command as the gold standard pattern:

```go
const viewDescription = `
View a task by providing its ID. You can output in markdown or JSON format.

Examples:
` +
	"```" +
	`

  backlog view T01           # View task T01 in markdown format
  backlog view T01 --json    # View task T01 in JSON format
  backlog view T01 -j        # View task T01 in JSON format (short flag)

` + "```"
```

**Key Elements:**
1. Description text
2. "Examples:" heading
3. Triple backticks (\`\`\`) for code block
4. Clean examples with inline comments
5. Proper spacing and indentation

## Files Modified

### Command Files (Source Code)

| File | Changes | Lines Changed |
|------|---------|---------------|
| `internal/cmd/task_list.go` | Converted to code block format | ~50 lines |
| `internal/cmd/task_create.go` | Converted to code block format, simplified examples | ~70 lines |
| `internal/cmd/task_edit.go` | Converted to code block format, simplified examples | ~80 lines |
| `internal/cmd/task_archive.go` | Added examples in code block format | +8 lines |
| `internal/cmd/conflicts.go` (doctor) | Converted to code block format | ~30 lines |

### Generated Documentation Files (Auto-Generated via `make docs`)
- `docs/reference/backlog_list.md` âœ…
- `docs/reference/backlog_create.md` âœ…
- `docs/reference/backlog_edit.md` âœ…
- `docs/reference/backlog_archive.md` âœ…
- `docs/reference/backlog_doctor.md` âœ…
- `docs/reference/backlog_view.md` âœ… (already correct)
- `docs/reference/README.md` âœ… (recreated)

## Example Improvements

### Before (Comment Style - Bad):
```markdown
# Edit tasks using the "backlog edit" command with its different flags.
# Let's assume you have a task with ID "42" that you want to modify.
# Here are some examples of how to use this command effectively:

# 1. Changing the Title
# Use the -t or --title flag to give the task a new title.
backlog edit 42 -t "Fix the main login button styling"

# 2. Updating the Description
# Use the -d or --description flag to replace the existing description with a new one.
backlog edit 42 -d "The login button on the homepage is misaligned..."
```

### After (Code Block - Good):
````markdown
Examples:
```

  # Change title
  backlog edit T42 -t "Fix the main login button"

  # Update description
  backlog edit T42 -d "The login button is misaligned on mobile"

  # Change status
  backlog edit T42 -s "in-progress"
  backlog edit T42 -s "done"

```
````

## Benefits Achieved

### For Website Rendering
- âœ… Examples now render in proper code blocks
- âœ… Syntax highlighting works correctly
- âœ… Clean, professional appearance
- âœ… Consistent formatting across all commands

### For Users
- âœ… Examples are easier to read
- âœ… Can copy-paste examples directly
- âœ… Shorter, more focused examples
- âœ… Better organized by category

### For Maintainability
- âœ… Single source pattern for all commands
- âœ… Auto-generated from source code
- âœ… Easy to update in future
- âœ… Consistent across the project

## Commands Updated

### âœ… backlog list
- **Before**: 67 lines of comment-style examples
- **After**: ~40 lines in organized code block
- **Improvements**: Grouped by category (filters, search, sorting, output, pagination)

### âœ… backlog create
- **Before**: 68 lines with verbose comments
- **After**: ~45 lines, cleaner examples
- **Improvements**: Removed redundant explanations, kept essential examples

### âœ… backlog edit
- **Before**: 97 lines with numbered sections
- **After**: ~50 lines, organized by operation type
- **Improvements**: Grouped by operation (change, assign, labels, AC, etc.)

### âœ… backlog archive
- **Before**: No examples
- **After**: Simple examples added
- **Improvements**: Shows basic usage patterns

### âœ… backlog doctor
- **Before**: Plain text list
- **After**: Organized code block with categories
- **Improvements**: Detection vs fixing examples separated

### âœ… backlog view
- **Already correct** - served as the template

## Verification

### Documentation Generation
```bash
make docs  # Successfully regenerates all docs
```

### Generated Files Verified
- âœ… `docs/reference/backlog_list.md` - Examples in code blocks
- âœ… `docs/reference/backlog_create.md` - Examples in code blocks
- âœ… `docs/reference/backlog_edit.md` - Examples in code blocks
- âœ… `docs/reference/backlog_archive.md` - Examples in code blocks
- âœ… `docs/reference/backlog_doctor.md` - Examples in code blocks

### Website Rendering
All commands should now render correctly on the documentation website with:
- Proper code block formatting
- Syntax highlighting
- Copy-paste functionality
- Professional appearance

## Pattern for Future Commands

When adding new commands, use this pattern:

```go
const commandDescription = `
Brief description of what the command does.

Examples:
` +
	"```" +
	`

  # Category name
  backlog command example1           # Brief comment
  backlog command example2 --flag    # Brief comment

  # Another category
  backlog command example3           # Brief comment

` + "```"

func newCommand(rt *runtime) *cli.Command {
	return &cli.Command{
		Name:        "command",
		Usage:       "Brief usage",
		Description: commandDescription,  // Use the const
		Flags:       []cli.Flag{...},
		Action:      func(...) error {...},
	}
}
```
