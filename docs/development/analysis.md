# Backlog Tool - Comprehensive Technical Analysis

## Executive Summary

The `backlog` project is a well-architected, Go-based CLI tool for task management that is offline-first and developer-centric. Its core design principle is storing tasks as individual Markdown files within a Git repository, making it highly portable and transparent. The codebase demonstrates strong adherence to modern Go practices, including clean separation of concerns, dependency injection for testability, and a robust CLI implementation. A key feature is its built-in Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, which exposes its functionality to AI agents, positioning it as a forward-thinking tool for AI-assisted development workflows. While the current implementation is performant for small to medium-sized projects, its scalability is limited by the design choice of reading all task files into memory for certain operations.

## 1. Project Architecture and Structure

The project follows a standard and effective Go project layout, with a clear separation of concerns that enhances maintainability and testability.

- **`main.go`**: The application's entry point. It's minimal and delegates all work to the `internal/cmd` package. It also includes a `//go:generate` directive to automate documentation generation.
- **`internal/`**: This directory contains all the core application logic, ensuring that no other project can import it and depend on its internal implementation details.
  - **`core/`**: This is the heart of the application, containing the business logic and data structures. It defines the `Task` struct, the `FileTaskStore` for data persistence, and the logic for all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete), search, and archive operations. It is completely decoupled from the CLI and any other presentation layer.
  - **`cmd/`**: This package implements the command-line interface using the **Cobra** library. Each command (e.g., `create`, `list`, `edit`) is in its own file (`task_create.go`, `task_list.go`), which keeps the code organized. It acts as the presentation layer, translating user input into calls to the `core` package.
  - **`commit/`**: This small package handles the Git integration. Its primary responsibility is to automatically commit changes to task files after an operation, providing a versioned history of the backlog.
  - **`mcp/`**: This package implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, exposing the `core` functionality as a set of tools for AI agents. This is a key architectural feature that separates human-computer interaction (CLI) from agent-computer interaction (MCP).
  - **`logging/`**: A dedicated package for configuring and providing a global logger using Go's standard `log/slog` library. It is configurable via environment variables.
  - **`tools/`**: Contains utility programs for development, such as the documentation generator (`docgen`).

This layered architecture is a significant strength, allowing each part of the system to be developed and tested independently.

## 2. Core Functionality and Features

The tool is rich with features designed for developers and AI agents:

- **File-Based Storage**: Tasks are stored as human-readable Markdown files with YAML frontmatter.
- **Git-Native**: The entire state is stored within a Git repository, and task modifications are automatically committed.
- **Hierarchical Tasks**: Supports parent-child task relationships with a dot-notation ID system (e.g., `T01`, `T01.01`).
- **Rich Metadata**: Tasks support assignees, labels, priorities, dependencies, and acceptance criteria.
- **Powerful CLI**: A comprehensive CLI for all task management operations, with filtering, sorting, and multiple output formats (table, JSON, Markdown).
- **AI Integration**: An MCP server exposes all core functionality as tools (`task_create`, `task_edit`, etc.) for programmatic use by AI agents.
- **Offline-First**: Works entirely offline, with all data stored locally.

## 3. Code Quality and Patterns

The codebase exhibits a high level of quality and adheres to modern Go idioms.

### Dependency Injection
The `FileTaskStore` is initialized with an `afero.Fs` interface. This is a prime example of dependency injection, allowing the filesystem to be replaced with an in-memory mock for testing.

**File**: `internal/core/store.go`
```go
// The store takes a filesystem interface, not a concrete implementation.
func NewFileTaskStore(fs afero.Fs, tasksDir string) *FileTaskStore {
    return &FileTaskStore{
        fs:       fs,
        tasksDir: tasksDir,
    }
}
```

### Interface-Driven Design
The `cmd` package depends on a `TaskStore` interface, not the concrete `FileTaskStore` implementation. This decouples the CLI from the storage layer.

**File**: `internal/cmd/root.go`
```go
type TaskStore interface {
    Get(id string) (*core.Task, error)
    Create(params core.CreateTaskParams) (*core.Task, error)
    // ... and other methods
}
```

### Custom Types for Type Safety
The project uses custom types like `TaskID`, `Status`, and `Priority` instead of primitive strings. This improves type safety and allows for custom validation and behavior. The `MaybeStringArray` type is a clever solution for unmarshaling YAML fields that can be either a single string or a list of strings.

**File**: `internal/core/task.go`
```go
// Custom type for handling flexible string/[]string YAML fields.
type MaybeStringArray []string

func (a *MaybeStringArray) UnmarshalYAML(value *yaml.Node) error {
    // ... implementation
}
```

### Clear Error Wrapping
Errors are wrapped with context using `fmt.Errorf("...: %w", err)`, which makes debugging easier.

**File**: `internal/core/create.go`
```go
if err != nil {
    return nil, fmt.Errorf("could not get next task ID: %w", err)
}
```

## 4. Dependencies and Technologies Used

The `go.mod` file reveals a carefully selected set of high-quality libraries:

- **`github.com/spf13/cobra`**: A powerful library for creating modern CLI applications.
- **`github.com/spf13/afero`**: A filesystem abstraction system that is crucial for the project's testability.
- **`go.yaml.in/yaml/v4`**: Used for marshaling and unmarshaling the YAML frontmatter in task files.
- **`github.com/go-git/go-git/v6`**: A pure Go implementation of Git used for the automatic commit feature.
- **`github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk`**: The official Go SDK for building the MCP server.
- **`github.com/agnivade/levenshtein`**: Used for fuzzy string matching when parsing `Status` and `Priority` inputs, making the CLI more user-friendly.
- **`github.com/olekukonko/tablewriter`**: Used to render clean, formatted tables in the CLI output.

## 5. CLI Implementation Details

The CLI is implemented cleanly in the `internal/cmd` package.

### Command Structure
`root.go` defines the root `backlog` command and persistent flags (`--folder`, `--auto-commit`). Each subcommand is in its own file (e.g., `task_create.go`).

### Flag Handling
Flags are defined in `init()` functions and their values are captured into package-level variables. This is a standard Cobra pattern.

### Context for State Management
The `TaskStore` instance is created in a `PersistentPreRun` function in `root.go` and passed to subcommand runners via the `context.Context`. This is an excellent way to provide shared dependencies to commands without using global variables.

**File**: `internal/cmd/root.go`
```go
func init() {
    // ...
    rootCmd.PersistentPreRun = func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
        // ...
        fs := afero.NewOsFs()
        var store TaskStore = core.NewFileTaskStore(fs, tasksDir)
        cmd.SetContext(context.WithValue(cmd.Context(), ctxKeyStore, store))
    }
}
```

## 6. Data Storage Mechanisms

The storage mechanism is a core concept of the tool.

- **Directory**: All tasks are stored in the `.backlog/` directory by default.
- **File Naming**: Files follow the convention `T{ID}-{slugified-title}.md` (e.g., `T01.01-add_google_oauth.md`). The slug is generated from the task title.
- **File Format**: Each file is a Markdown document with a YAML frontmatter block.
  - The **frontmatter** contains structured metadata like `id`, `title`, `status`, `parent`, `labels`, etc.
  - The **body** is Markdown and contains sections for `Description`, `Acceptance Criteria`, `Implementation Plan`, and `Implementation Notes`. The `task.Bytes()` method in `internal/core/task.go` programmatically constructs this file content.

## 7. Task Management Features

The tool supports a comprehensive set of task management features.

### Hierarchical Tasks
The `TaskID` type (`internal/core/id.go`) is an array of integers, naturally representing a hierarchy. The `getNextTaskID` function in `internal/core/store.go` contains the logic to find the next available ID at any level of the hierarchy.

### Acceptance Criteria (AC)
The `update_ac.go` file contains a dedicated `ACManager` to handle adding, removing, checking, and unchecking AC items by index, which is a robust way to manage list-based modifications.

### Dependencies
Tasks can declare dependencies on other tasks via the `dependencies` field. The `core.Create` and `core.Update` functions validate that these dependencies exist.

## 8. Error Handling and Logging

### Logging
The `internal/logging/config.go` package provides a centralized logging setup using `log/slog`. It's configurable via environment variables for level (`BACKLOG_LOG_LEVEL`), format (`BACKLOG_LOG_FORMAT`), and output file (`BACKLOG_LOG_FILE`), which is excellent for debugging.

### Error Propagation
Errors are generally handled at the `cmd` layer. The `core` functions return errors, and the command runners check for `err != nil`, log the error, and then call `os.Exit(1)`. This is a standard and effective pattern for CLI tools.

## 9. Testing Coverage

The project has a strong testing culture.

### Test Infrastructure
- **Makefile**: The `Makefile` includes `test` and `cover` targets, making it easy to run tests and check coverage.
- **Filesystem Mocking**: The use of `afero.NewMemMapFs()` in test files (e.g., `internal/core/create_test.go`) is the cornerstone of the testing strategy. It allows the storage layer to be tested thoroughly and quickly without touching the actual disk.
- **Test Structure**: Tests are well-organized. For example, `internal/cmd/task_list_test.go` and `task_search_test.go` contain comprehensive table-driven tests covering many combinations of flags and filters.
- **Assertion Library**: `github.com/matryer/is` is used for assertions, leading to readable and concise test code.

## 10. Performance Considerations

The primary performance consideration is the `loadAll()` method in `internal/core/list.go`.

### Current Approach
For `list` and `search` operations, the tool reads every single task file in the `.backlog` directory into memory, parses it, and then performs filtering or searching.

### Impact
This approach is simple and works well for hundreds of tasks. However, for a project with thousands of tasks, the I/O and parsing overhead on every command run would lead to noticeable latency.

## 11. Security Aspects

As a local CLI tool, the security attack surface is minimal. However, the following points are relevant:

- **File Path Sanitization**: The `slugRegex` in `internal/core/task.go` sanitizes the task title before creating a filename, which helps prevent path traversal or other filename-based attacks.
- **MCP Server**: The MCP server (`internal/cmd/mcp.go`) binds to `localhost` by default when using HTTP transport. This is a secure default, as it prevents external network access. If a user were to expose this on a public interface, it would need to be secured.
- **Command Injection**: The `commit` package uses the `go-git` library, which is a pure Go implementation. This avoids calling the `git` executable directly and eliminates the risk of command injection vulnerabilities.

## 12. Areas for Improvement

### Performance Optimization
To improve scalability, an index file (e.g., a single JSON or Gob file) could be maintained in the `.backlog` directory. This index would store essential metadata for all tasks. The `list` and `search` commands could read this single file instead of all individual task files, resorting to reading the full file only for `view` or `edit` operations. This would trade some of the "pure Markdown" simplicity for a significant performance gain.

### Refactor Shared CLI Flags
The flags for filtering and sorting are duplicated across `task_list.go` and `task_search.go`. This logic could be extracted into a shared helper function to reduce code duplication and ensure consistency.

### Consolidate Utility Functions
The `ptr` helper function is defined in multiple places (`internal/core/archive.go`, `internal/cmd/helpers_test.go`, etc.). It should be moved to a common internal utility package.

### Interactive Edit Mode
The `edit` command could be greatly enhanced by launching a TUI (Terminal User Interface) form, allowing the user to edit all fields of a task in an interactive session.

## 13. Technical Debt

The codebase is remarkably clean and appears to have very little technical debt. The documentation is thorough, the code is well-commented where necessary, and the architecture is sound. The aforementioned duplication of CLI flags is a minor form of technical debt but is easily addressable. The project's extensive use of its own `backlog` system for task management (as seen in the `.backlog` directory) is a testament to its quality and a great example of "dogfooding".

## 14. Scalability Considerations

The primary scalability bottleneck is the file-based storage model combined with the `loadAll()` pattern.

### Current Limitation
The system will likely perform well up to a few thousand tasks. Beyond that, the latency of reading and parsing thousands of files on every `list` or `search` command will become prohibitive.

### Scaling Path
If massive scale were a requirement, the `TaskStore` interface provides the perfect abstraction point. A new implementation (e.g., `SqliteTaskStore`) could be created to use a more scalable backend like SQLite. This would require a migration path but could be done without changing the `cmd` or `mcp` layers, demonstrating the strength of the current architecture. However, this would be a fundamental departure from the project's core "files in Git" philosophy.
