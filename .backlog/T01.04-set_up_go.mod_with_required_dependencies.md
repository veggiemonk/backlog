## Description

Configure go.mod file with all necessary dependencies for the project

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->

- [ ] #1 All required dependencies added to go.mod
- [ ] #2 Dependencies: cobra, afero, yaml/v4, go-git, mcp go-sdk, levenshtein, tablewriter
- [ ] #3 Dependency versions pinned appropriately
- [ ] #4 Go mod tidy run successfully

<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

1. Add github.com/spf13/cobra for CLI framework\n2. Add github.com/spf13/afero for filesystem abstraction\n3. Add go.yaml.in/yaml/v4 for YAML processing\n4. Add remaining dependencies: go-git, mcp-sdk, levenshtein, tablewriter\n5. Run go mod tidy to clean up"
