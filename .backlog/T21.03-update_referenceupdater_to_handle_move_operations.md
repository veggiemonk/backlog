## Description

Extend the existing ReferenceUpdater to properly handle references when a task is moved (ID changes). This includes updating dependencies and ensuring child tasks maintain correct parent references.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->

- [ ] #1 ReferenceUpdater.UpdateReferences() handles ID changes from move operations
- [ ] #2 All tasks with moved task in dependencies list are updated
- [ ] #3 Child tasks of moved task maintain correct parent reference (may need update if parent hierarchy changed)
- [ ] #4 Method preserves the 'T' prefix format in dependencies (e.g.
- [ ] #5  T01.01)
- [ ] #6 UpdateReferences tracks changes in task history
