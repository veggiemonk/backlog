## Description

Create a new suite of integration tests specifically designed to simulate concurrent task creation. These tests should attempt to create multiple tasks for the same parent simultaneously and verify that no ID conflicts occur.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->

- [x] #1 A new test file create_concurrent_test.go is created.
- [x] #2 The test uses goroutines to trigger concurrent calls to FileTaskStore.CreateTask.
- [x] #3 The test asserts that all tasks are created successfully with unique
- [x] #4  sequential IDs.
- [x] #5 The test cleans up all created task files.

<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

1. Create create_concurrent_test.go. 2. Create FileTaskStore with MockLocker. 3. Use WaitGroup and goroutines for concurrent store.Create calls. 4. Verify unique, sequential IDs. 5. Ensure test cleanup.

## Implementation Notes

Developed concurrency test for task creation. The test uses goroutines to simulate concurrent creation and verifies unique ID generation, confirming the fix for the race condition.
