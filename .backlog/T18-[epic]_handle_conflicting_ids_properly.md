## Description

if a user create a task in 2 separate branches, the IDs will collide. Backlog needs to be able to detect and fix those colliding IDs as well as keeping an history of what was fixed and how

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->

- [x] #1 ID conflict detection system implemented in internal/core/conflict.go
- [x] #2 Multiple resolution strategies implemented (chronological
- [x] #3  auto
- [x] #4  manual)
- [x] #5 Enhanced history tracking with ID change metadata
- [x] #6 Git integration for pre/post-commit conflict detection
- [ ] #7 CLI commands for 'backlog conflicts detect' and 'backlog conflicts resolve'
- [ ] #8 Reference update system maintains task relationships
- [ ] #9 Comprehensive test suite with conflict scenarios
- [ ] #10 Documentation updated with conflict resolution procedures

<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

1. Design and implement conflict detection system
2. Build conflict resolution strategies (chronological, auto, manual)
3. Add comprehensive history tracking for ID changes
4. Integrate with Git workflow for automatic detection
5. Create CLI commands for conflict management
6. Implement reference updating system
7. Add comprehensive testing
8. Update documentation

## Implementation Notes

Implemented comprehensive ID conflict handling system for backlog CLI:

**Core Components:**
- ConflictDetector: Scans tasks and identifies duplicate IDs, orphaned children, and invalid hierarchy
- ConflictResolver: Multiple strategies (chronological, auto, manual) for resolving conflicts
- ReferenceUpdater: Maintains task relationships when IDs change
- Enhanced HistoryEntry with metadata tracking for ID changes

**CLI Integration:**
- `backlog conflicts detect` - JSON and text output formats
- `backlog conflicts resolve` - Multiple strategies with dry-run support

**Git Integration:**
- Pre-commit conflict detection
- Post-merge automatic resolution
- Enhanced commit functions with conflict checking

**Files Modified:**
- internal/core/conflict.go (new, 686 lines)
- internal/core/task.go (enhanced history tracking)
- internal/cmd/conflicts.go (new CLI commands)
- internal/commit/git.go (conflict detection integration)

**Key Features:**
- Chronological resolution keeps older tasks, renumbers newer ones
- Reference updating maintains parent-child and dependency relationships
- Comprehensive history tracking with conflict resolution metadata
- Dry-run mode for safe conflict resolution planning
