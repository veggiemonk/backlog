## Description

Create the CLI command interface for the move operation. This command parses arguments, calls the core Move method, and displays results to the user.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->

- [ ] #1 File internal/cmd/task_move.go exists with moveCmd definition
- [ ] #2 Command is registered in root command
- [ ] #3 Command accepts task ID as first positional argument
- [ ] #4 Command has --parent flag that accepts parent task ID
- [ ] #5 Command validates required arguments are provided
- [ ] #6 Command calls FileTaskStore.Move() with parsed IDs
- [ ] #7 Command outputs success message with old and new IDs
- [ ] #8 Command handles and displays errors clearly (task not found
- [ ] #9  cycle detected
- [ ] #10  etc.)
- [ ] #11 Command supports both T-prefixed and numeric ID formats
