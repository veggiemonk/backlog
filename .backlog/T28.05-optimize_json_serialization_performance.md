## Description

Optimize JSON marshaling and unmarshaling performance for large task datasets to meet response time requirements.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->

- [ ] #1 JSON serialization optimized
- [ ] #2 Memory allocation reduced
- [ ] #3 Response times under 2s for 10k tasks

<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

1. Profile current JSON performance
2. Implement streaming JSON where possible
3. Optimize memory allocation patterns
4. Validate performance improvements
