## Description

Build unit tests for all core business logic

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->

- [ ] #1 Unit tests for all core task operations
- [ ] #2 Table-driven test patterns
- [ ] #3 Edge case coverage
- [ ] #4 Error condition testing
- [ ] #5 Mock filesystem usage

<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

1. Write tests for core operations\n2. Use table-driven test patterns\n3. Cover edge cases and errors\n4. Use mock filesystem consistently\n5. Achieve comprehensive coverage"
