## Description

Establish the basic project structure, build system, and development environment for the backlog CLI tool from scratch.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->

- [ ] #1 Go module initialized with proper naming
- [ ] #2 Makefile configured with all build targets
- [ ] #3 Basic main.go entry point created
- [ ] #4 Dependencies defined in go.mod
- [ ] #5 Go module initialized with proper naming (github.com/veggiemonk/backlog)
- [ ] #6 Makefile configured with all build targets (build, test, lint, clean, docs, cover)
- [ ] #7 Basic main.go entry point created with version handling
- [ ] #8 Dependencies defined in go.mod with all required packages

<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

1. Initialize Go module with proper naming\n2. Create basic directory structure (internal/cmd, internal/core, internal/mcp, etc.)\n3. Set up Makefile with comprehensive build targets\n4. Create main.go entry point with version info\n5. Define all required dependencies in go.mod
