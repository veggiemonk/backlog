## Description

Implement task listing with status, parent, assignee filtering

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->

- [ ] #1 ListTasks function with filtering options
- [ ] #2 Filter by status (todo, in-progress, done, etc.)
- [ ] #3 Filter by parent task ID
- [ ] #4 Filter by assignee names
- [ ] #5 Filter by labels
- [ ] #6 Sorting options (ID, title, status, priority)
- [ ] #7 Pagination support for large lists

<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

1. Implement ListTasks with FilterOptions struct\n2. Add status filtering logic\n3. Implement parent and assignee filtering\n4. Add label-based filtering\n5. Include sorting capabilities\n6. Handle large result sets"
