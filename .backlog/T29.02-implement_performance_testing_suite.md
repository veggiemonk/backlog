## Description

Create performance tests to validate response times, memory usage, and concurrent request handling for MCP operations.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->

- [ ] #1 Performance test suite created
- [ ] #2 Response time validation
- [ ] #3 Memory usage testing
- [ ] #4 Concurrent request testing

<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

1. Create internal/mcp/performance_test.go
2. Test response times with various dataset sizes
3. Monitor memory usage during operations
4. Test concurrent request handling
