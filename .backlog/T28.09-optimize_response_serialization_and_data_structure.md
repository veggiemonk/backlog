## Description

Optimize JSON serialization, reduce memory allocations, and implement efficient data structures for large datasets. Focus on achieving sub-2s response times for 10k tasks.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->

- [ ] #1 JSON serialization optimized
- [ ] #2 Memory allocation reduced
- [ ] #3 Efficient data structures for large datasets
- [ ] #4 Sub-2s response times for 10k tasks achieved

<!-- AC:END -->
