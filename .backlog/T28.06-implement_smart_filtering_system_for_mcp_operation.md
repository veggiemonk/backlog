## Description

Create intelligent filtering capabilities that optimize query performance by pre-filtering data at the store level rather than post-processing. Include support for compound filters, index-based lookups, and query optimization.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->

- [x] #1 Store-level filtering implemented for all list operations
- [x] #2 Compound filter support (AND/OR logic)
- [x] #3 Query optimization for common filter patterns
- [x] #4 Filtering performance benchmarks created

<!-- AC:END -->
