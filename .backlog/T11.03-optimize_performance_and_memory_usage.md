## Description

Performance tuning for large task sets

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->

- [ ] #1 Memory usage optimization
- [ ] #2 Performance benchmarking
- [ ] #3 Large task set handling (1000+ tasks)
- [ ] #4 Concurrent operation support
- [ ] #5 Resource cleanup

<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

1. Optimize memory usage\n2. Create performance benchmarks\n3. Test with large task sets\n4. Add concurrency support\n5. Implement resource cleanup"
