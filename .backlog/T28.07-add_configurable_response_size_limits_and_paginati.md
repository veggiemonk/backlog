## Description

Implement a robust pagination system with configurable limits to handle large datasets efficiently. Include automatic pagination suggestions when responses would exceed limits.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->

- [x] #1 Configurable response size limits
- [x] #2 Automatic pagination for large datasets
- [x] #3 Response size estimation and monitoring
- [x] #4 Pagination metadata in responses

<!-- AC:END -->
