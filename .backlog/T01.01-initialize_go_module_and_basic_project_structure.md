## Description

Set up the Go module with proper naming and create the basic directory structure for the project

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->

- [ ] #1 Go module initialized with 'github.com/veggiemonk/backlog' naming
- [ ] #2 Basic directory structure created (internal/cmd, internal/core, internal/mcp)
- [ ] #3 Go version compatibility set to 1.25+

<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

1. Run 'go mod init github.com/veggiemonk/backlog'\n2. Create internal/ directory structure\n3. Set Go version requirement to 1.25+ in go.mod
