## Description

Implement stress tests to validate MCP server behavior under high load and with very large datasets.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->

- [ ] #1 Stress test suite created
- [ ] #2 High load testing implemented
- [ ] #3 Large dataset stress testing

<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

1. Create stress test scenarios
2. Test with 10k+ task datasets
3. Test concurrent user scenarios
4. Validate system stability under load
