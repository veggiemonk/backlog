## Description

Create comprehensive Makefile with all necessary targets for development workflow

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->

- [ ] #1 Makefile with build target creating bin/backlog
- [ ] #2 Test target running go test -v ./...
- [ ] #3 Lint target with go vet ./...
- [ ] #4 Clean target removing build artifacts
- [ ] #5 Docs target for CLI documentation generation
- [ ] #6 Cover target with HTML coverage report

<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

1. Create comprehensive Makefile with all required targets\n2. Set up build target to compile to bin/backlog\n3. Configure test target with verbose output\n4. Add lint target using go vet\n5. Include coverage reporting with HTML output
