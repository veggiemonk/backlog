## Description

Refactor the CLI commands for list and search to remove the manual pagination logic and the redundant data fetches. The commands will now call the updated core methods and use the returned ListResult directly. The ApplyDefaultPagination function will also be removed.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->


<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

1. Modify runList in internal/cmd/task_list.go to use ListResult.
2. Remove redundant total count fetch in runList.
3. Simplify pagination info creation in runList.
4. Modify runSearch in internal/cmd/task_search.go to use ListResult.
5. Remove redundant total count fetch in runSearch.
6. Simplify pagination info creation in runSearch.
7. Delete internal/cmd/pagination.go.
